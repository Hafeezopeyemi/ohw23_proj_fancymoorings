Different python libraries that we have interactivity options:

Holoviz:
https://holoviz.org/ - Main holoviz plotting tools
https://panel.holoviz.org/getting_started/index.html - Panel, a tool to build interactive web apps

Streamlit:
https://streamlit.io/ - Main streamlit interactive web app page

Shiny:
We were only briefly able to test the use of Shiny, another commonly used interactive web app.
Shiny has options for both Python and R interactivity.
