Data page for display and downloading mooring data

To run the website, the instructions are the same as on the [OHW github pages site](https://github.com/oceanhackweek/oceanhackweek.github.io/blob/source/_InstructionSiteUpdates.md):

* Install the environment: `conda env create --file environment.yml` and then activate it: `conda activate ohw-site`
* Make sure `make` is installed: `conda install make`
* `make live` will update a browser version. If you are using the cloud, you can find the `index.html` files in the _build/dirhtml folders you can use to preview the pages with
* `make html` makes a HTML output
* `make clean` cleans up the build directories

Team members (so far): **Seth Travis, Lu Guan, Samantha Huntington, Andrea Hilborn, Hafeez Opeyemi Oladejo, Tobias Ferreira, Johnathan Evanilla, Veronica Martinez**

* The goal is to download and create plots (temperature, salinity and oxygen) for mooring data from Vancouver Island and Puget Sound.
* We'd like to summarize this in a page hosted on Github Pages.
* Other things that might be fun include having an interactive map and / or some interactive plots.
