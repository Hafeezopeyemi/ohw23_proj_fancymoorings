Data page for display and downloading mooring data

Team members (so far): **Seth Travis, Lu Guan, Samantha Huntington, Andrea Hilborn, Hafeez Opeyemi Oladejo, Tobias Ferreira, Johnathan Evanilla**

* The goal is to download and create plots (temperature, salinity and oxygen) for mooring data from Vancouver Island and Puget Sound.
* We'd like to summarize this in a page hosted on Github Pages.
* Other things that might be fun include having an interactive map and / or some interactive plots.
