## Goals

* Access mooring data (such as temperature, salinity, oxygen, etc.) from the Vancouver Island and Puget Sound region
* Visualize the data using multiple interactive plotting tools like [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), [Holovis](https://holoviz.org/), and [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/)
* Build a webpage to host the plots to highlight what data exists in this region

Its objectives are to:
				
- Promote data and software proficiency in ocean scientists: Provide participants with computational and data science skills that can advance oceanography research, which often requires the integration and manipulation of diverse sources of data and models.
- Facilitate inclusive community building: Connect oceanographers across disciplines and career stages and cultivate an open science and a sharing culture.
